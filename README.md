# Programming Goals

1. Data Structure
2. Algorithms
3. Core Java 1.8
4. Best Practices (Comments, Readable, Maintainable code)

# Path to be followed
~~~
Recursion -> Linked list -> Stack -> Queue -> Two pointers -> Sliding-window -> hashing -> sorting -> binary search -> trees -> BST -> Heaps -> Graph basics -> BFS -> DFS -> backtracking -> greedy -> Dynamic programming -> advanced graph -> Union find -> bit manipulation.
